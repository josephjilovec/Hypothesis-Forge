Hypothesis Forge
Hypothesis Forge is an AI-driven system designed to accelerate scientific discovery by generating and ranking novel hypotheses from complex datasets, such as AlphaFold protein structures and NASA astrophysical data. Aligned with xAI's mission to advance human scientific understanding, it integrates data ingestion, simulation, reinforcement learning (RL), knowledge graph management, and an interactive dashboard to provide a robust pipeline for scientific hypothesis generation. The system is modular, containerized with Docker, and deployable on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability.
Project Overview
Hypothesis Forge processes raw scientific datasets, runs simulations (e.g., protein folding, gravitational dynamics), generates hypotheses using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL agent, cross-references them for novelty via PubMed and arXiv APIs, and visualizes results in a Streamlit-based dashboard. Key features include:

Data Ingestion: Preprocesses raw datasets (PDB, FITS) using Pandas, BioPython, and Astropy.
Simulation Engine: Executes AI-driven (PyTorch) or physics-based simulations, optimized for <5-minute runtime.
RL Hypothesis Generation: Uses a PPO agent to propose novel "what-if" scenarios based on simulation outputs.
Knowledge Graph: Builds a Neo4j graph to store research relationships and compute novelty scores.
Interactive Dashboard: Displays simulation results and ranked hypotheses with Plotly visualizations and JavaScript interactivity.
Deployment: Containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with auto-scaling.

The repository is structured for modularity, with comprehensive tests (>80% coverage) and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Python: 3.9
Docker: Latest version for containerization
AWS CLI: For deployment (optional)
Neo4j: Community edition for knowledge graph
Git: For cloning the repository

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/josephjilovec/Hypothesis-Forge.git
cd Hypothesis-Forge


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r deploy/requirements.txt

Dependencies include numpy, pandas, torch, biopython, astropy, neo4j, requests, streamlit, plotly, and pytest.

Set Up Neo4j:

Install Neo4j Community Edition locally or use a cloud-hosted instance.
Update knowledge/research_api.py and knowledge/graph_builder.py with your Neo4j credentials (URI, user, password).


Prepare Data:

Place raw datasets in data/raw/alphafold/ (PDB files) and data/raw/nasa/ (FITS files).
Run data/preprocess.py to generate processed data:python data/preprocess.py




Run Locally:

Start the Streamlit dashboard:streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.enableStaticServing


Access at http://localhost:8501.


Build and Run with Docker:

Build the Docker image:docker build -t hypothesis-forge -f deploy/Dockerfile .


Run the container:docker run -p 8501:8501 hypothesis-forge


Access at http://localhost:8501.



Deployment to AWS

Configure AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) in your environment or GitHub Actions secrets.
Use deploy/aws_config.yml to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk:eb init -p docker hypothesis-forge --region us-east-1
eb deploy hypothesis-forge-env



Live Demo
A live demo of Hypothesis Forge is available at: https://hypothesis-forge-demo.example.com (placeholder, update with actual URL after deployment).
Usage Examples
1. Preprocessing Data
Process raw AlphaFold PDB and NASA FITS files:
python data/preprocess.py

This generates cleaned datasets in data/processed/ (e.g., test_processed.parquet).
2. Running Simulations
Execute simulations using the simulation engine:
python simulation/sim_engine.py

Outputs results to simulation/results/ (e.g., test_processed_results.parquet).
3. Generating and Ranking Hypotheses
Generate hypotheses using the RL agent and rank them:
python hypothesis/agent.py  # Requires environment setup
python hypothesis/hypothesis_ranking.py

Ranked hypotheses are saved to hypothesis/ranked_hypotheses.json.
4. Cross-Referencing with APIs
Cross-reference hypotheses for novelty using PubMed and arXiv:
python knowledge/research_api.py

Results with novelty scores are saved to hypothesis/cross_referenced_hypotheses.json.
5. Viewing the Dashboard
Launch the Streamlit dashboard to visualize results:
streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.enableStaticServing


Navigate to "Simulations" to view 3D protein or astrophysical plots.
Navigate to "Hypotheses" to see ranked hypotheses with scores.

Testing
Run unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability:
pytest tests/ -v

Tests cover data preprocessing, simulations, RL, API queries, and dashboard functionality, achieving >80% coverage.
