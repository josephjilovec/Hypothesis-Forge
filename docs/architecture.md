Hypothesis Forge System Architecture
Overview
Hypothesis Forge is an AI-driven system designed to accelerate scientific discovery by generating and ranking novel hypotheses from complex scientific datasets. It integrates data ingestion, simulation, reinforcement learning (RL), knowledge graph management, and an interactive dashboard to provide a seamless pipeline for hypothesis generation and visualization. The system is modular, containerized, and deployable on cloud platforms like AWS or DigitalOcean, aligning with xAI's mission to advance human scientific discovery.
This document describes the system architecture, detailing each component's role, interactions, and implementation. A Mermaid diagram illustrates the high-level data flow and component interactions.
System Components
1. Data Ingestion (data/)
Purpose: Ingests and preprocesses raw scientific datasets (e.g., AlphaFold PDB files, NASA FITS files) to prepare them for simulations.

Key Files:

preprocess.py: Cleans and formats raw data, handling missing values and normalizing data. Outputs processed data to data/processed/ in parquet format.
Inputs: Raw datasets in data/raw/alphafold/ (PDB files) and data/raw/nasa/ (FITS files).
Outputs: Cleaned datasets in data/processed/ (e.g., test_processed.parquet).


Implementation:

Uses Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
BioPython for parsing PDB files (protein structures).
Astropy for handling FITS files (astrophysical data).
Includes error handling for invalid file formats and logging for debugging.



2. Simulation Engine (simulation/)
Purpose: Runs physics-based or AI-driven simulations on preprocessed data to model complex systems (e.g., protein folding, gravitational dynamics).

Key Files:

sim_engine.py: Orchestrates simulation runs, loading data from data/processed/ and models from simulation/models/.
models/proteinsim.py: Implements protein folding simulation using PyTorch for energy minimization.
models/astrosim.py: Simulates astrophysical systems (e.g., N-body gravitational interactions) using PyTorch.
Outputs: Simulation results saved to simulation/results/ in parquet format.


Implementation:

Uses PyTorch for AI-driven simulations with neural networks.
Optimized for performance to complete in <5 minutes on a t3.medium instance.
Includes error handling for simulation timeouts and invalid data.



3. RL Hypothesis Generation (hypothesis/)
Purpose: Generates novel "what-if" scientific hypotheses using reinforcement learning based on simulation outputs.

Key Files:

agent.py: Implements a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL agent using PyTorch to propose hypotheses.
environment.py: Defines a custom OpenAI Gym environment for scientific discovery, using simulation outputs as the state space and rewarding novelty/feasibility.
hypothesis_ranking.py: Ranks hypotheses based on novelty (cosine similarity) and feasibility (domain-specific criteria). Outputs ranked hypotheses to hypothesis/ranked_hypotheses.json.


Implementation:

PPO Agent: Uses a policy network to select actions (hypotheses) based on simulation states.
Environment: Rewards hypotheses for novelty (based on history) and feasibility (based on state magnitude).
Ranking: Combines novelty and feasibility scores with weights (e.g., 0.7 novelty + 0.3 feasibility) and outputs JSON for the dashboard.



4. Knowledge Graph (knowledge/)
Purpose: Cross-references hypotheses for novelty by querying research APIs and storing relationships in a Neo4j knowledge graph.

Key Files:

graph_builder.py: Builds a Neo4j graph with nodes (papers, topics) and relationships (citations, hypothesis-paper links) using PubMed and arXiv data.
research_api.py: Queries PubMed and arXiv APIs to check hypothesis novelty and updates the Neo4j graph. Outputs novelty scores to hypothesis/cross_referenced_hypotheses.json.


Implementation:

Uses neo4j Python driver for graph operations.
requests library for API calls to PubMed and arXiv.
Novelty score is inversely proportional to the number of related papers in the graph.
Includes error handling for API failures and database connection issues.



5. Interactive Dashboard (frontend/)
Purpose: Visualizes simulation results and ranked hypotheses in an intuitive web interface.

Key Files:

app.py: Main dashboard script using Streamlit to render visualizations and hypothesis tables.
static/css/style.css: Styles the dashboard with a modern, responsive design.
static/js/interactive.js: Adds interactivity (e.g., clickable hypothesis lists) using vanilla JavaScript (simplified from D3.js/Three.js for stability).
templates/index.html: HTML template for the dashboard layout, with placeholders for visualizations and tables.


Implementation:

Streamlit: Renders the dashboard, serving custom HTML and injecting data for JavaScript.
Plotly: Generates 3D scatter plots for protein structures and astrophysical systems as fallbacks.
Responsive design ensures usability on various devices.
Error handling for missing data and rendering issues.

Data Flow Explanation

Data Ingestion: Raw datasets are ingested and cleaned by preprocess.py, stored in data/processed/.
Simulation: sim_engine.py loads processed data and runs simulations using proteinsim.py or astrosim.py, saving results to simulation/results/.
Hypothesis Generation: The RL environment (environment.py) uses simulation results as states, interacting with the PPO agent (agent.py) to generate hypotheses.
Hypothesis Ranking: hypothesis_ranking.py ranks hypotheses based on novelty and feasibility, saving to hypothesis/ranked_hypotheses.json.
Knowledge Graph: research_api.py queries PubMed/arXiv APIs, updates the Neo4j graph via graph_builder.py, and computes novelty scores.
Dashboard: app.py loads simulation results and ranked hypotheses, rendering them via index.html with styling (style.css) and interactivity (interactive.js).

Deployment

Docker: The application is containerized using deploy/Dockerfile, with dependencies listed in deploy/requirements.txt.
AWS Configuration: deploy/aws_config.yml defines an Elastic Beanstalk environment with a t3.medium instance, auto-scaling, and S3 storage for data.
Port: Exposes port 8501 for the Streamlit dashboard.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (ci.yml) automates testing and deployment to AWS.

Design Decisions

Modularity: Each component (data, simulation, hypothesis, knowledge, frontend) is isolated with clear interfaces, enabling easy updates or replacements.
Performance: Simulations are optimized to run in <5 minutes using PyTorch and GPU acceleration (if available).
Scalability: Docker and AWS auto-scaling ensure the system handles varying loads.
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and error handling in all scripts ensure robustness.
Open-Source: MIT license (LICENSE) encourages community contributions.

Future Improvements

Add support for more dataset formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Enhance RL agent with advanced algorithms (e.g., SAC, A3C).
Integrate additional APIs (e.g., Google Scholar) for broader novelty checks.
Improve dashboard interactivity with WebGL-based visualizations (e.g., reintroduce Three.js once stable).

This architecture ensures Hypothesis Forge is a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system for AI-driven scientific discovery, aligned with xAI's mission.
